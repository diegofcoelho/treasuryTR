# treasuryTR

While Treasury yields are easy to come by (see [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/), total return (TR) indices are not. The latter is earned by investors, and is therefore of paramount importance e.g. when simulating a treasury-stock diversified portfolio. A supplier for proprietary TR Treasury index data is [CRSP](http://www.crsp.org/). Their data can be purchased or accesses trough a handful of commercial research platforms.


Swinkels (2019) compute returns from publicly available yield-to-maturity data using *standard (fixed-income) textbook formulas*. See also the following post on quant.stackexchange: https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/57403
