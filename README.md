While Treasury yields are easy to come by[^FRED], total return (TR) indices are not. The latter is earned by investors, and is therefore of paramount importance e.g. when simulating a treasury-stock diversified portfolio. A supplier for proprietary TR Treasury index data is CRSP[^CRSP]. Their data can be purchased or accesses trough a handful of commercial research platforms.

Swinkels (2019) compute returns from publicly available yield-to-maturity data using *standard (fixed-income) textbook formulas*.[^quantoverflow]
